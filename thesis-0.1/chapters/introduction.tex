Quantum cascade laser is a type of semiconductor emitting mid-infrared portion of electromagnetic spectrum. This frequency range allows a multitude of applications especially in the field of spectroscopy where it serves the detection of toxic chemicals, explosives, and drugs. In this context, the mbsolve Project provides the required simulation relying on C++ programming with a Python user interface. This Engineer's practice aims at the design of this interface.\\
Chapter \ref{chapter:theory} provides the theoretical background and starting point. In chapter \ref{chapter:conception}, the conception and realisation of the project will be described and detailed. The outcome is presented in chapter \ref{chapter:results}. The discussion of the results concludes this work.
