Quantum cascade laser is a type of semiconductor emitting mid-infrared portion of electromagnetic spectrum. This frequency range allows a multitude of applications especially in the field of spectroscopy where it enables the detection of toxic chemicals, explosives, and drugs. In this context, the mbsolve Project provides the required simulation relying on C++ programming. This engineer's practice aims at the design of a Python user interface for this project.\\
Chapter \ref{chapter:theory} provides the theoretical background and starting point. Chapter \ref{chapter:conception} describes the conception and realisation of the project. The results are detailed in chapter \ref{chapter:results}, followed by a conclusion, discussing the outcome.
