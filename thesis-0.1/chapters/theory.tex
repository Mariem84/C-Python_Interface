\setlength\parindent{12pt} In this project,a high performing programming language was required for the simulation because of the large size of data and the elaborate numerical treatments. C++ fullfills these criteria not to mention that it is available everywhere and reasonably well standardized. Nevertheless it has some drawbacks: First of all it is not interactive and implementing it for user-interfaces (especially graphic user interfaces) can be quite complex. That is why it was opted for Python for the interface which brings flexibilty interactivity and simplicity(see Tab.~\ref{table:settings}).\\
To sum it up, the goal is to create a common interface that enables the user to wrap different C++ libraries in Python modules and load them dynamically during the execution of the program.\\
