\chapter{Conclusion}

The Python/C++ Interface is estimated to be the most suitable way to combine the efficiency and performance of C++ programming with the flexibility and interactivity of Python. SWIG was implemented to create the wrappers needed to access the C++ Library from Python and so making the interfacing simple and automatic. Nevertheless, there are other possibilities to achieve this goal such as Cython which is a Python like language for writing C/C++ extensions. In addition, further opmisations can be seeked on Windows using Visual Studio.
