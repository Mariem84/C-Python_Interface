\chapter{Conclusion}

The Python/C++ Interface is estimated to be the most suitable way to combine the efficiency and performance of C++ programming with the flexibility and interactivity of Python. SWIG was implemented to automatically create the wrappers needed to access the C++ Library from Python. Nevertheless, there are other possibilities to achieve this goal, such as Cython which is a Python like language for writing C/C++ extensions. In addition, further optimizations can be seeked on Windows using Visual Studio.
