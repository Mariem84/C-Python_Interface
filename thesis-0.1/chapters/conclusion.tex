\chapter{Conclusion}

The Python/C++ Interface is estimated to be the most suitable way to combine the efficiency and performance of C++ programming with the flexibility and interactivity of Python. This goal was achieved through implementing SWIG to automatically create the wrappers needed to access the C++ Library from Python. Not only is it possible for the user to choose the Python version but it also features functionality on both Linux on Windows. However, it was not possible to structure the project on Windows (organizing files in folders according to their role), the time assigned to the engineer's practice didn't allow such optimizations, but they can be strived, using Visual Studio for example.
